The server project is a multi tier api.

This means that there are 2 servers running as part of the project

The client application will only call the end points which are specified in the web layer.
By only exposing these end points the database call end points are protected.
This makes them impossible to access externally

This protects the database as an attacker cannot see the end point calls which access the database
