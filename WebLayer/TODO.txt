- add request limit middleware

- Rework error handling
the error handling does not always describe the issue to the user / developer
errors are too generic and need more specificity
Dev errors to include --> filename, function/route, error message, error code, line, data
Return errors to include --> 
come up with a set of allowed codes / error types which can be returned. If the error does not fit within these codes, return 500

- Rework Logging to be more useful

- Add in comments and documentation for how to work on the server
